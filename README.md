# SwaggerVS (Swagger Vulnerability Scanner)

SwaggerVS is a vulnerability scanner specifically designed for APIs defined using the Swagger (OpenAPI) specification. This tool is written in Python and leverages Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) mechanisms to analyze and detect vulnerabilities in web applications based on APIs.

Key Features:
API Scanning: Capable of performing thorough scans of APIs defined in Swagger specifications.
Vulnerability Detection: Identifies various vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.
Easy Integration: Can be integrated into CI/CD workflows to automatically maintain API security.

Installation
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Pip (Python package manager)
- PyYaml module
- Requests module

Installation Steps:
1. Clone the Repository:
'''
git clone https://github.com/redhawkeye/swaggervs.git
cd swaggervs
'''
   
2. Install Dependencies:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

Usage:
1. Running a Scan
'''
python swaggervs.py -f swagger.yml <URL_TARGET>
'''

-f: The swagger.yml configuration to scan.

2. Example Usage
'''
python swaggervs.py -f swagger.yml https://vulnapi.csalab.app
'''

## DAST Mechanism

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing technique performed on applications that are running. DAST scans by directly interacting with the application, mimicking end-user behavior. The key steps in the DAST mechanism used by SwaggerVS include:

- Endpoint Analysis: SwaggerVS reads the Swagger specification to identify available API endpoints.
- Input Testing: Sends requests with various malicious payloads to the detected endpoints.
- Response Monitoring: Analyzes server responses to detect signs of vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

SwaggerVS is a valuable tool for ensuring the security of Swagger-based APIs. By using DAST mechanisms, this tool helps developers and security teams identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
